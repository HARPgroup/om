function mathProcessor2( $sEquation, $arData) {
/* USAGE:
   There are two parameters you pass the function. One being a string equation such as:

   $sEquation = '100*([field1]+[field2])/40*([field3]+[field4])';

   And the second parameter is an associative array of data. The keys for this associative arrays are items you can use in the above math expression to specify replacements. So if I have an associative array like:

   $arData = array( 'field1' => 1,
   'field2' => 2,
   'field3' => 3,
   'field4' => 4);

   it would change the above expression to:
   100*(1+2)/40*(3+4)
